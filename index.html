    <h1>The Story of Hyde</h1>
    <h2>By [Anthony Veliz]</h2>
    <p>The Story is about the life of a character named Hyde, he has many goals but one of his biggest problems is that he didn't grow up with a silver spoon in his mouth, instead, he struggled his way up to the top and was able to obain all his goals by working hard and was able to get the dream job he wanted since he was a kid. I made this because I felt like it would be a great story and it can send a positive message. The message is, nothing is handed to you, you need to work hard if you want to make your dreams come true if you really want it. </p>
